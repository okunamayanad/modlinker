Displays a Modrinth link next to CurseForge and other Minecraft mod sites (9Minecraft, Planet Minecraft, mc-mod).

As Modrinth doesn't have as good as a SEO of these websites, Modrinth tends to be at the lower results, sometimes not even in the first page.

I don't want to use CurseForge because of their policies and just their UX being much worse than Modrinth imo.

I think it's not just me that wants to search for a mod and just click on a Modrinth link right away, so if you think the same way as I do, [why not just install the extension right now?](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/modlinker/kffdacoooplmddelfddkndfhgenddgke)
